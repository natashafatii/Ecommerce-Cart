# 🛒 E-Commerce Cart (DSA Project)

This project implements a **console-based E-Commerce Cart System** using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in C++.  
It demonstrates how core data structures — **Linked Lists**, **Queues**, and **Binary Search Trees (BST)** — can be used to build a mini e-commerce shopping system with efficient data organization and operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The E-Commerce Cart project is designed to simulate a real-world online shopping platform.  
It allows users to:
- Register, log in, and manage their profile
- Add/remove products
- Search and filter products
- Manage inventory efficiently
- Apply discounts
- Add products to cart and checkout securely  

All operations are implemented using **classic DSA techniques** to demonstrate their real-life applications.

## 💡 Motivation

In today's digital shopping world, e-commerce systems are everywhere.  
Our goal was to understand how **data structures** can power such systems — making them **efficient, organized, and scalable**.  
We wanted to explore the combination of **software logic** and **data organization** to create a smart and optimized virtual store.
